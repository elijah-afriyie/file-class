## Question

How can you create a Java program that writes the following poem to a file named `poem.txt` using `FileWriter`:

```
Roses are red
Violets are blue
You're incredibly beautiful, and I love you so much.
```

Ensure that the program handles any potential `IOException` that might occur during the file writing process.
