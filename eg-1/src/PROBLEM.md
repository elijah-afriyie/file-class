## Question

How can you create a Java program that checks for the existence of a file named `secret_message.txt` and prints the following details if the file exists:

1. Confirmation that the file exists
2. The relative path of the file
3. The absolute path of the file
4. Whether it is a file

Additionally, handle the scenario where the file does not exist by printing an appropriate message. 

Also, include a commented-out line of code that would delete the file if it exists.
